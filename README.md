ROME is a framework generator for event based data analysis. In the ROME environment, the experimenter defines the analysis framework for his experiment in a very clear and compact way in a XML file. Out of this framework definition file, ROME generates all experiment specific classes of the framework. The experimenter only needs to add the calculation code to pre-generated event methods.
