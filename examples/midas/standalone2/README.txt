This directory contains an example for showing how to use ROMEMidasFile class for a standalone program to read MIDAS files in offline.

Usage: (for bash)
$ make .
$ ./analyzer

In this example, source and header files of some classes in ROME are used; the source files are compiled for this example.
In this example, only the raw data is read from a MIDAS file, and the decoding needs to be implemented by a user according to the bank definition.


If you prefer to use a higher level handle for MIDAS files rather than this example, you may choose to use MidasDAQ class which is generated by ROMEBuilder, therefore, already contains your bank structure.
You can try ../standalone.
